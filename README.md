# PQRShiny
An attempt to enable PQRS within an R shiny interface

## Summary
I haven't been able to find any modern PQRS apps that are still functional. I'm planning to construct a Shiny version here.

So far I only have a proof of concept for a beta distribution. The next step would be to highlight areas under the curve to visualise how hypothesis testing works.
